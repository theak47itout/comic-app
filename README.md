# DASHTOON ASSIGNMENT
Objective:
Developed a simple web application based on REACT Js that allows users to create and share a 10-panel comic strip. The comic is generated by inputting text into a form, which is then sent to a text-to-image API using a provided API key. This API is provided by DASHTOON!

It uses React version 18.2 and Tailwind CSS version 3.2.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/thepranaygupta/react-tailwind-css-starter-pack.git
    ```

1. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    cd react-tailwind-css-starter-pack
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
1. Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view your project.
1. Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes. You can also create new CSS files and import them into your components.

The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
